# Lucky Scratch

**Lucky Scratch** generates a random grid of symbols and calculates your reward based on:

- **Standard Symbols** (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F): If at least one winning combination occurs (like 3 of the same symbol),
  you earn a multiplied payout.
- **Bonus Symbols** (e.g., 10x, +500, MISS): Applied only if there is a winning combination. Only the first bonus found
  takes effect.
